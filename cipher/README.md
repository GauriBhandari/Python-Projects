# Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Vigenère cipher, a classical method of encrypting alphabetic text. The Vigenère cipher is a form of polyalphabetic substitution that uses a keyword and shifts letters in the plaintext by different amounts for each letter in the keyword.
