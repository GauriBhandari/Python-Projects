# Probability Calculator

## Overview

This project aims to determine the approximate probability of drawing specific balls randomly from a hat. It employs object-oriented programming principles to create a `Hat` class, representing a hat containing balls of various colors. Additionally, it includes an `experiment` function to conduct multiple experiments and estimate the probability based on the outcomes.

## Features

1. **Hat Class**: The `Hat` class initializes a hat object with a specified number of balls of different colors. It provides a `draw` method to randomly draw a specified number of balls from the hat without replacement.

2. **Experiment Function**: The `experiment` function calculates the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls from the hat in a given number of experiments. It takes the hat object, the expected combination of balls, the number of balls to draw, and the number of experiments as inputs.
